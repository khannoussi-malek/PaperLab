    """A live-check run on 2026-10-03 found a stuck job: suggest_status froze at "stopping" and the advisory lock
    stayed held forever, blocking every future suggestion run on that workspace until someone manually restarted
    the worker and reset the row. Root cause: the advisory lock is session-level (tied to one physical Postgres
    connection), but the old code took and released it through the ORM `session`, whose own connection can rotate
    to a *different* pooled connection on every `session.commit()` under real concurrent load (e.g. the frontend
    polling GET /screening while the job runs). The lock-holding connection drifted away mid-job and went idle in
    the pool, still holding the lock, forever.

    `test_screening_suggest_worker.py`'s own `session` fixture can't reproduce this: it pins every statement to
    one connection via `AsyncSession(bind=connection, ...)`, so it never rotates. This test instead runs the
    worker against a real small connection pool, with concurrent "noise" queries racing the job's own per-hit
    commits to force genuine rotation — the same way real production traffic does — and then proves the lock is
    actually free afterward by taking it from a separate connection, not just that some statement was executed.

    This one is probabilistic, not deterministic: forcing a specific connection-pool checkout order depends on
    real asyncio/asyncpg scheduling, not on anything this test controls directly. Measured empirically against
    the pre-fix code (a scratch run, not this suite): roughly 25-35% of runs actually hit the leak: under, not
    over, rotation starves the bug of a chance to happen, and over-rotation gives everyone their own connection
    back with no contention either. The test above is the deterministic guard; this one is corroborating
    evidence for the property that actually matters in production, not the sole gate on it."""
