    §4/§13.

    `identified` is `sum(stats_json.per_source_raw_count.values())` (raw, pre-dedup database-search counts — only
    search_batch's worker loop writes that field) plus one per stored hit whose source_method isn't
    "database_search". Snowball hits have no stats_json entry of their own (snowball() never writes one), so
    without that second term `identified` would under-count the moment any snowball hit exists in the workspace
    and `duplicates_removed = max(identified - len(hits), 0)` would silently clamp to 0 instead of reporting a
    real number — this also matches PRISMA convention, where citation-chasing is its own "identified via other
    methods" line. Applied identically in both branches: a snowball hop's own lightweight run (snowball()
    creates one per call, WorkspaceSearchHit.run_id is NOT NULL) reports its own hit as identified in its own
    per-run breakdown too, since the per-run hit_query below is already scoped to that run_id."""
