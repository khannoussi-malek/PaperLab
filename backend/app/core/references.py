"""A library paper's references and citing works: fetched once, stored, ranked for this library (M7.5).

- Semantic Scholar answers both directions; OpenAlex is merged in when it's ticked (D77). Stored in `external_refs`
  and `paper_references`, so ranking can count how many library papers share a reference (D78).
- Ranking is tiers (D80): co-citation inside the library, closeness to the reader's notes, a free PDF, citation count.
  A reference is in the library by `IN_LIBRARY`, the one match the tab, the References page and the graph share.
- Importing downloads a free PDF exactly as Find papers' Add does (D84); nothing is fetched for the new paper (P5).
