// A spec that marks a model default (PUT /api/llm/default) moves the one shared `is_default` row. Every spec
// using the `llmName`/`llmConnection` fixtures snapshots "the owner's default" at setup and restores it at
// teardown (fixtures.ts); if that snapshot races a concurrent default change, it restores the wrong model. Any
// such spec carries this tag, which puts it in its own single-worker project running after everything else, so
// nothing else is ever mid-test while the default moves. A tag, not a filename: a new spec that moves the
// default says so itself instead of quietly losing the protection. `@moves-paper-sources` is the same for the one
// paper-sources row: a test that changes the switches or the email must not run beside a search or an ingest.
// `@moves-setup` is the same for the one setup flag: a spec that sets it back to not done would send every other
// page to `#/setup`.
